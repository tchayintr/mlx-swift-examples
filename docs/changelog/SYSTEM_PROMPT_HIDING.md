# System Prompt Hiding Feature for MLX Swift Chat

## Feature Description

Added functionality to hide system messages from the chat interface display, creating a more professional and clean user experience. System prompts remain active for model behavior but are no longer visible in the conversation UI.

- **Feature**: System messages are filtered out from the conversation display
- **Benefit**: Professional chat appearance without exposing internal prompts to users
- **Scope**: Affects UI display only - system messages remain functional for model guidance

## Implementation Details

### Core Change

Modified the conversation view to filter out system messages while preserving them in the underlying data model.

**File**: `Applications/MLXChatExample/Views/ConversationView.swift`

**Code Change**:
```swift
// Before: All messages displayed including system prompts
ForEach(messages) { message in
    MessageView(message)
        .padding(.horizontal, 12)
}

// After: System messages filtered out for cleaner UI
ForEach(messages.filter { $0.role != .system }) { message in
    MessageView(message)
        .padding(.horizontal, 12)
}
```

## Technical Details

1. **Filter Logic**: Simple role-based filtering using `$0.role != .system`
2. **Data Preservation**: System messages remain in the `messages` array for model processing
3. **UI Impact**: Only affects visual display in ConversationView
4. **Functionality**: Model continues to receive and process system prompts normally

## Files Modified

1. **Applications/MLXChatExample/Views/ConversationView.swift**
   - Line 18: Added filter to exclude system role messages from display

## Benefits

- ✅ **Clean professional chat interface**
- ✅ **System prompts remain functional for model behavior**
- ✅ **No impact on chat functionality or model performance**
- ✅ **Simple one-line implementation**
- ✅ **No data loss - system messages preserved in memory**

## Use Cases

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Production chat applications
- Customer-facing interfaces
- Professional demos and presentations
- Any scenario where internal model instructions should remain hidden

## Testing

The feature has been verified to:
- Hide system messages from conversation display
- Maintain system prompt functionality for model behavior
- Preserve all user and assistant messages in the UI
- Work correctly with message threading and responses

## Example System Prompt

The default system prompt that gets hidden:
```
"You are Chinda LLM, powering the ChindaGo app by iApp Technology. Respond helpfully and accurately, primarily in Thai."
```

This prompt continues to guide model behavior but is no longer visible to end users.

## Reproduction Steps

To apply this feature to a fresh MLX Swift codebase:

1. Open `Applications/MLXChatExample/Views/ConversationView.swift`
2. Locate line 18 with the ForEach loop: `ForEach(messages) { message in`
3. Replace with: `ForEach(messages.filter { $0.role != .system }) { message in`
4. Test that system messages are hidden but model behavior is preserved

## Compatibility

- **MLX Swift Version**: Compatible with current mlx-swift-examples repository
- **iOS/macOS**: Works on all supported platforms
- **Model Types**: Compatible with all LLM models (Gemma, Llama, etc.)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing message data structures
